# Building and running
You can run `scripts/francis` to build and run. Arguments passed will be forwarded onto francis.

# Tests
Run `scripts/test.sh`. You will need a device/emulator attached.

# Debugging
Consult the log files. Even if you don't request debug logs, they will be logged.
Look in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/francis/runs` (defaults to
`~/.local/share/francis/runs`) for logs from past runs.
